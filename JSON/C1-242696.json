The SMF shall not include any mapped EPS bearer contexts\nassociated with a PDU session for LADN and with a PDU session which is a\nmulti-homed IPv6 PDU session. If the UE receives any mapped EPS bearer\ncontext for a PDU session for LADN or for a multi-homed IPv6 PDU\nsession, the UE may locally delete the mapped EPS bearer context. See\ncoding of the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE in subclause\u00a09.11.4.8. In an\nMA PDU session, the UE shall have one set of the mapped EPS bearer\ncontexts. The network can provide the set of the mapped EPS bearer\ncontexts of the MA PDU session via either access of the MA PDU session.\nIn an MA PDU session, the UE shall support modification or deletion via\nan access of a mapped EPS bearer context of the MA PDU session created\nvia the same or the other access.  \nUpon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall create\nthe default EPS bearer context and the dedicated EPS bearer context(s)\nbased on the parameters of the mapped EPS bearer contexts or the\nassociations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session,\nif available. The EPS bearer identity assigned for the QoS flow of the\ndefault QoS rule becomes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer\nin the corresponding PDN connection. If there is no EPS bearer identity\nassigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule of a PDU session\nassociated with 3GPP access, or if there is no corresponding mapped EPS\nbearer contexts associated with the EPS bearer identity assigned to the\nQoS flow of the default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP\naccess:  \na\\) the PDU session is not an MA PDU session established over both 3GPP\naccess and non-3GPP access, the UE shall perform a local release of the\nPDU session; or  \nb\\) the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over both 3GPP\naccess and non-3GPP access, the UE shall perform a local release of the\nPDU session over 3GPP access and consider that the MA PDU session is\nestablished over non-3GPP access only.  \nIf there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow(s) of a PDU\nsession associated with 3GPP access which is not associated with the\ndefault QoS rule, or if there is no corresponding mapped EPS bearer\ncontexts associated with the EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS\nflow of the non-default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP\naccess, unless the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over\n3GPP access and over non-3GPP access, the UE shall locally delete the\nQoS rules and the QoS flow description(s). The UE uses the parameters\nfrom each PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported to\ncreate corresponding default EPS bearer context and optionally dedicated\nEPS bearer context(s) as follows:  \na\\) the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN\ntype of the default EPS bearer context as follows:  \n1\\) the PDN type shall be set to \\\"non-IP\\\" if the PDU session type is\n\\\"Unstructured\\\";  \n2\\) the PDN type shall be set to \\\"IPv4\\\" if the PDU session type is\n\\\"IPv4\\\";  \n3\\) the PDN type shall be set to \\\"IPv6\\\" if the PDU session type is\n\\\"IPv6\\\";  \n4\\) the PDN type shall be set to \\\"IPv4v6\\\" if the PDU session type is\n\\\"IPv4v6\\\";  \n5\\) the PDN type shall be set to \\\"non-IP\\\" if the PDU session type is\n\\\"Ethernet\\\", and the UE, the network or both of them do not support\nEthernet PDN type in S1 mode; and  \n6\\) the PDN type shall be set to \\\"Ethernet\\\" if the PDU session type is\n\\\"Ethernet\\\" and the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1\nmode;  \nb\\) the PDU address of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN\naddress of the default EPS bearer context as follows:  \n1\\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to the PDU\naddress of the PDU session, if the PDU session type is \\\"IPv4\\\",\n\\\"IPv6\\\" or \\\"IPv4v6\\\"; and  \n2\\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to zero, if\nthe PDU session type is \\\"Ethernet\\\" or \\\"Unstructured\\\";  \nc\\) the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default\nEPS bearer context, unless the PDU session is an emergency PDU session;  \nd\\) the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR received in the parameters of the\ndefault EPS bearer context of the mapped EPS bearer contexts shall be\nmapped to the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR of the default EPS bearer\ncontext;  \ne\\) for each PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE, PDU SESSION\nMODIFICATION PENDING or PDU SESSION INACTIVE PENDING:  \n1\\) if the UE is performing an inter-system change from N1 mode to WB-S1\nmode, the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context(s) to\nBEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE; or  \n2\\) if the UE is performing an inter-system change from N1 mode to NB-S1\nmode, for the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to the default EPS\nbearer, the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context to\nBEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. Additionally, if the UE is performing an\ninter-system change from WB-N1 mode to NB-S1 mode, for the mapped EPS\nbearer context corresponding to a dedicated EPS bearer, if any, the UE\nshall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT\nINACTIVE; and  \nf\\) for any other PDU session the UE shall set the state of the mapped\nEPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.  \nAdditionally, for each mapped EPS bearer context or the association\nbetween QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session:  \na\\) the EPS bearer identity shall be set to the EPS bearer identity\nreceived in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS bearer identity\nassociated with the QoS flow;  \nb\\) the EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped EPS QoS parameters\nof the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS\nQoS parameters associated with the QoS flow;  \nc\\) the extended EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped extended\nEPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer\ncontext, or the extended EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS\nflow; and  \nd\\) the traffic flow template shall be set to the mapped traffic flow\ntemplate of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or\nthe stored traffic flow template associated with the QoS flow, if\navailable.  \nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall\nassociate the PDU session identity, the S-NSSAI, and the session-AMBR\nwith the default EPS bearer context, and for each EPS bearer context\nmapped from one or more QoS flows, associate the QoS rule(s) for the QoS\nflow(s) and the QoS flow description(s) for the QoS flow(s) with the EPS\nbearer context.  \nIf the PDU session is associated with the control plane only indication\nand supports interworking with EPS, after inter-system change from N1\nmode to S1 mode, the UE shall associate the EPS bearer context(s) of the\nPDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the control plane\nonly indication.  \nIf the PDU session is associated with a PDU session pair ID, after\ninter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall associate the\ndefault EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the\nPDU session with the PDU session pair ID. If the PDU session is\nassociated with an RSN, after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1\nmode, the UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN\nconnection corresponding to the PDU session with the RSN.  \nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if:  \na\\) the UE sent the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator and\nreceived the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator in the PDU\nsession; or  \nb\\) the PDU session is associated with the URSP provisioning in EPS\nsupport indicators;  \nthe UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN\nconnection corresponding to the PDU session with the URSP provisioning\nin EPS support indicators.  \nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF\nshall maintain the PDU session type of the PDU session until the PDN\nconnection corresponding to the PDU session is released if the UE\nsupports non-IP PDN type and the PDU session type is \\\"Ethernet\\\" or\n\\\"Unstructured\\\".  \nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF\nshall maintain the following 5GSM attributions and capabilities\nassociated with the PDU session until the PDN connection corresponding\nto the PDU session is released:  \na\\) the always-on PDU session indication;  \nb\\) the maximum number of supported packet filters;  \nc\\) the support of reflective QoS;  \nd\\) the maximum data rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection\nsupported by the UE for uplink and the maximum data rate per UE for\nuser-plane integrity protection supported by the UE for downlink;  \ne\\) the support of multi-homed IPv6 PDU session; and  \nf\\) if the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP\naccess, the PDN connection of the default EPS bearer corresponding to\nthe MA PDU session shall be considered as a user-plane resource of the\nMA PDU session.  \nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE operating in\nsingle-registration mode in a network supporting N26 interface shall\ndeem that the following features are supported by the network on the PDN\nconnection corresponding to the PDU session:  \na\\) PS data off; and  \nb\\) Local address in TFT.  \nIf there is a QoS flow used for IMS signalling, after inter-system\nchange from N1 mode to S1 mode, the EPS bearer associated with the QoS\nflow for IMS signalling becomes the EPS bearer for IMS signalling.  \nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the SMF shall\nmaintain protocol description for UL PDU set handling, if available,\nuntil the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released.  \nWhen the UE is provided with a new session-AMBR in the Protocol\nconfiguration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE\nin the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall discard\nthe corresponding association and associate the new valuewith the\ndefault EPS bearer context.  \nThe network may provide the UE with one or more QoS rules by including\neither one QoS rules parameter, or one QoS rules with the length of two\noctets parameter, but not both, in the Protocol configuration options IE\nor Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER\nCONTEXT REQUEST message. The network may provide the UE with one or more\nQoS flow descriptions corresponding to the EPS bearer context being\nmodified, by including either one QoS flow descriptions parameter, or\none QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter, but\nnot both, in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol\nconfiguration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST\nmessage.  \nWhen the UE is provided with one or more QoS flow descriptions or the\nEPS bearer identity of an existing QoS flow description is modified in\nthe Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration\noptions IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE\nshall check the EPS bearer identity included in the QoS flow\ndescription; and:  \na\\) if the EPS bearer identity corresponds to the EPS bearer context\nbeing modified or the EPS bearer identity is not included, the UE shall\nstore the QoS flow description and all the associated QoS rules, if any,\nfor the EPS bearer context being modified for use during inter-system\nchange from S1 mode to N1 mode; and  \nb\\) otherwise the UE shall locally delete the QoS flow description and\nall the associated QoS rules, if any, and include a Protocol\nconfiguration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE\nwith a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #84 \\\"syntactical error in\nthe QoS operation\\\" in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.  \nWhen the UE is provided with one or more QoS rules, or one or more QoS\nflow descriptions in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended\nprotocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT\nREQUEST message, the UE shall process the QoS rules sequentially\nstarting with the first QoS rule and shall process the QoS flow\ndescriptions sequentially starting with the first QoS flow description.\nThe UE shall check the QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions for different\ntypes of errors as follows:  \nNOTE\u00a01: If an error is detected in a QoS rule or a QoS flow description\nwhich requires sending a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended\nprotocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause value, then the QoS\nrules parameter, the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter,\nthe QoS flow descriptions parameter and the QoS flow descriptions with\nthe length of two octets parameter included in the Protocol\nconfiguration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE\nin the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message are discarded, if any.  \nNOTE\u00a02: If the EPS bearer context modification procedure is rejected,\nthen the QoS rules parameter, the QoS rules with the length of two\noctets parameter, the QoS flow descriptions parameter and the QoS flow\ndescriptions with the length of two octets parameter included in the\nProtocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration\noptions IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message are\ndiscarded, if any.  \na\\) Semantic errors in QoS operations:  \n1\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and add packet\nfilters\\\", \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters\\\",\n\\\"Modify existing QoS rule and delete packet filters\\\" or \\\"Modify\nexisting QoS rule without modifying packet filters\\\" on the default QoS\nrule and the DQR

rule and delete\npacket filters\\\", or \\\"Modify existing QoS rule without modifying packet\nfilters\\\" and two or more QoS rules associated with this PDU session\nwould have identical precedence values.  \n6\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and delete\npacket filters\\\", the QoS rule is a QoS rule of a PDU session of IPv4,\nIPv6, IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDU session type, and the packet filter list in\nthe resultant QoS rule is empty.  \n7\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Create new QoS rule\\\", and there is\nalready an existing QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier and the\nexisting QoS rule is associated with a QoS flow description stored for\nthe EPS bearer context being modified or the existing QoS rule is not\nassociated with any QoS flow description.  \n8\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and add packet\nfilters\\\", \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters\\\",\n\\\"Modify existing QoS rule and delete packet filters\\\", or \\\"Modify\nexisting QoS rule without modifying packet filters\\\" and there is no\nexisting QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier associated with a\nQoS flow description stored for the EPS bearer context being modified.  \n9\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Delete existing QoS rule\\\" and there is\nno existing QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier associated with a\nQoS flow description stored for the EPS bearer context being modified.  \n10\\) When the flow description operation is \\\"Create new QoS flow\ndescription\\\" and there is already an existing QoS flow description with\nthe same QoS flow identifier stored for the EPS bearer context being\nmodified.  \n11\\) When the flow description operation is \\\"Modify existing QoS flow\ndescription\\\" and there is no existing QoS flow description with the\nsame QoS flow identifier stored for the EPS bearer context being\nmodified.  \n12\\) When the flow description operation is \\\"Delete existing QoS flow\ndescription\\\" and there is no existing QoS flow description with the\nsame QoS flow identifier stored for the EPS bearer context being\nmodified.  \n13\\) When the UE determines that:  \ni\\) the default EPS bearer context is associated with one or more QoS\nflows but the default EPS bearer context is not associated with the\ndefault QoS rule.  \nii\\) a dedicated EPS bearer context is associated with one or more QoS\nflows but the dedicated EPS bearer context is associated with the\ndefault QoS rule.  \n14\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Create new QoS rule\\\" and there is\nalready an existing QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier\nassociated with a QoS flow description stored for an EPS bearer context\ndifferent from the EPS bearer context being modified and belonging to\nthe same PDN connection as the EPS bearer context being modified.  \n15\\) When the flow description operation is \\\"Create new QoS flow\ndescription\\\", and there is already an existing QoS flow description\nwith the same QoS flow identifier stored for an EPS bearer context\ndifferent from the EPS bearer context being modified and belonging to\nthe same

QoS rule\nand replace all packet filters\\\", \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and delete\npacket filters\\\", or \\\"Modify existing QoS rule without modifying packet\nfilters\\\" and the resultant QoS rule is associated with a QoS flow\ndescription stored for an EPS bearer context different from the EPS\nbearer context being modified.  \n17\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Create new QoS rule\\\", the DQR bit is\nset to \\\"the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule\\\", the QoS rule is\nprovided for a PDN connection of PDN type \\\"non-IP\\\" and there is\nlocally available information associated with the PDN connection that is\nset to \\\"Unstructured\\\".  \n18\\) When the flow description operation is \\\"Create new QoS flow\ndescription\\\" or \\\"Modify existing QoS flow

\\\"non-IP\\\" and there is locally available\ninformation associated with the PDN connection that is set to\n\\\"Unstructured\\\".  \n19\\) When the rule operation is \\\"Modify existing QoS rule and add\npacket filters\\\", the \\\"packet filter list\\\" field contains a match-all\npacket filter, the resultant QoS rule is the default QoS rule and there\nis already an existing match-all packet

MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received) is not the\ndefault QoS rule and the old QoS rule is associated with a QoS flow\ndescription stored for the EPS bearer context being modified, the UE\nshall not diagnose an error, shall further process the new request and,\nif it was processed successfully, shall delete the old QoS rule which\nhas identical precedence value. Otherwise, the UE shall include a\nProtocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration\noptions IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #83 \\\"semantic\nerror in the QoS operation\\\" in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT\nmessage.  \nIn case 6, if the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule, the UE shall\ndelete the QoS rule.

The CR, titled \"Update UL PDU Set handling when inter-system change,\" was sourced from Nokia and forwarded to TSG C1. The reason for the change is to address the need for the UE and SMF to remember and maintain protocol descriptions when an inter-system mode change occurs from N1 mode to S1 mode to EPS during UL PDU session establishment for XR in 5GS. The summary of the change involves updating the Stage 3 specification to ensure the maintenance of protocol descriptions associated with PDU sets in such scenarios. Failure to approve this change would result in the inability to handle UL PDU sets during inter-system mode changes. The affected clauses are 6.1.4.1 and 6.3.2.2. This CR aims to enhance the coordination between 5GSM and ESM with the N26 interface and improve the network-requested PDU session modification procedure initiation."], "embeddings": [[-0.008711831,
