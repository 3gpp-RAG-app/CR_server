The AMF shall\nnot assign a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NB-N1 mode and\ntracking areas not in NB-N1 mode. The UE, upon receiving a REGISTRATION\nACCEPT message, shall delete its old TAI list and store the received TAI\nlist. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was received over non-3GPP\naccess, the AMF shall include a single TAI in the TAI list.  \nNOTE\u00a02: For non-3GPP access, the operator can allocate a TAI per N3IWF,\nTNGF, TWIF or W-AGF. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF is locally\nconfigured with a TAI. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF can be configured\nwith its own TAI value, or with the same TAI value as other N3IWFs,\nTNGFs, TWIFs or W-AGFs.  \nNOTE\u00a03: When assigning the TAI list, the AMF can take into account the\neNodeB\\'s capability of support of CIoT 5GS optimization.  \nThe AMF may include service area restrictions in the Service area list\nIE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE, upon receiving a\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the service area restrictions shall act\nas described in subclause\u00a05.3.5.  \nThe AMF may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the REGISTRATION\nACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC).\nThe UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the\ninitial registration procedure is not for emergency services, the UE\nshall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the\nforbidden PLMN list as specified in subclause\u00a05.3.13A. In addition, the\nUE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN\nthat sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt\nof the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

The\nAMF of a PLMN shall not include a list of equivalent SNPNs.  \nIf the ESI bit of the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST\nmessage is set to \\\"equivalent SNPNs supported\\\", the AMF of a SNPN may\ninclude a list of equivalent SNPNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.\nIf the initial registration request is for onboarding services in SNPN,\nthe AMF shall not include a list of equivalent SNPNs in the REGISTRATION\nACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains an SNPN identity. The UE\nshall store the list as provided by the network. If the initial\nregistration procedure is not for emergency services and is not the\ninitial registration for onboarding services in SNPN, the UE shall\nremove from the list any SNPN identity that is already in:  \n\\- the \\\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\\\" list or the \\\"temporarily\nforbidden SNPNs\\\" list, if the SNPN is not an SNPN selected for\nlocalized services in SNPN (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0\\[5\\]); or  \n\\- the \\\"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services\nin SNPN\\\" list or the \\\"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for\nlocalized services in SNPN\\\" list, if the SNPN is an SNPN selected for\nlocalized services in SNPN (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0\\[5\\]).  \nThe UE shall add to the stored list the SNPN identity of the registered\nSNPN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each\nreceipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored\nlist. The AMF of an SNPN shall not include a list of equivalent PLMNs.  \nNOTE\u00a03A: If N1 mode was disabled for an SNPN due to reception of 5GMM\ncause #27 or #62,\u00a0the UE implementation ensures that it does not\nregister to this SNPN due to being part of the list of \\\"equivalent\nSNPNs\\\" received while registered in another SNPN.  \nIf the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, the\nUE is not registered for disaster roaming services, and if the PLMN\nidentity of the registered PLMN is a member of the forbidden PLMN list\nas specified in subclause\u00a05.3.13A, any such PLMN identity shall be\ndeleted from the corresponding list(s).  \nIf the Service area list IE is not included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage, any tracking area in the registered PLMN and its equivalent\nPLMN(s) in the registration area, or in the registered SNPN, is\nconsidered as an allowed tracking area as described in subclause\u00a05.3.5.  \nIf the REGISTRATION REQUEST message contains the LADN indication IE,\nbased on the LADN indication IE, UE subscription information, UE\nlocation and local configuration about LADN and:  \n\\- if the LADN indication IE includes requested LADN DNNs, the UE\nsubscribed DNN list includes the requested LADN DNNs or the wildcard\nDNN, and the LADN service area of the requested LADN DNN has an\nintersection with the current registration area, the AMF shall determine\nthe requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE as LADN DNNs\nfor the UE;  \n\\- if no requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE and the\nwildcard DNN is included in the UE subscribed DNN list, the AMF shall\ndetermine the LADN DNN(s) configured in the AMF whose LADN service area\nhas an intersection with the current registration area as LADN DNNs for\nthe UE; or  \n\\- if no requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE and the\nwildcard DNN is not included in the UE subscribed DNN list, or if the UE\nsubscribed DNN list does not include any of the DNN\\'s in the LADN\nindication IE, the AMF shall determine the LADN DNN(s) included in the\nUE subscribed DNN list whose LADN service area has an intersection with\nthe current registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE.  \nIf the LADN indication IE is not included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST\nmessage, the AMF shall determine the LADN DNN(s) included in the UE\nsubscribed DNN list whose service area has an intersection with the\ncurrent registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE, except for the\nwildcard DNN included in the UE subscribed DNN list.  \nIf the UE supports WUS assistance information and the AMF supports and\naccepts the use of WUS assistance information for the UE, then the AMF\nshall determine the negotiated UE paging probability information for the\nUE, store it in the 5GMM context of the UE, and if the UE is not\nperforming the initial registration for emergency services, the AMF\nshall include it in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE in the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF may consider the UE paging\nprobability information received in the Requested WUS assistance\ninformation IE when determining the negotiated UE paging probability\ninformation for the UE.  \nNOTE\u00a04: Besides the UE paging probability information requested by the\nUE, the AMF can take local configuration or previous statistical\ninformation for the UE into account when determining the negotiated UE\npaging probability information for the UE.  \nIf the UE sets the NR-PSSI bit to \\\"NR paging subgrouping supported\\\" in\nthe 5GMM capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF\nsupports and accepts the use of PEIPS assistance information for the UE,\nthen the AMF shall determine the Paging subgroup ID for the UE, store it\nin the 5GMM context of the UE, and shall include it in the Negotiated\nPEIPS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in\nthe Updated PEIPS assistance information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE\nCOMMAND message as part of the registration procedure. The AMF may\nconsider the UE paging probability information received in the Requested\nPEIPS assistance information IE when determining the Paging subgroup ID\nfor the UE.  \nNOTE\u00a05: Besides the UE paging probability information when provided by\nthe UE, the AMF can also take local configuration, whether the UE is\nlikely to receive IMS voice over PS session calls, UE mobility pattern\nor previous statistical information for the UE or information provided\nby the NG-RAN into account when determining the Paging subgroup ID for\nthe UE.  \nIf the UE set the UN-PER bit to \\\"unavailability period supported\\\" in\nthe 5GMM capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF\nsupports and accepts the use of unavailability period for the UE, then\nthe AMF shall set the UN-PER bit to \\\"unavailability period supported\\\"\nin the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage. Furthermore, if the AMF is able to determine a UE\nout-of-coverage period based on satellite coverage availability\ninformation, the AMF:  \na\\) shall store the determined unavailability period duration;  \nb\\) may store the start of the unavailability period; and  \nc\\) shall determine whether the UE is required to perform the\nregistration procedure in NG-RAN satellite access when the\nunavailability period has ended and set the EURP bit to \\\"UE needs to\nreport end of unavailability period \\\" or \\\"UE does not need to report\nend of unavailability period\\\" in the Unavailability configuration IE;\nand  \nprovide them to the UE by including the Unavailability configuration IE\nin the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. When the unavailability period\nstarts, the AMF shall consider the UE as unreachable until the UE\nregisters for normal service again.The AMF may determine the periodic\nregistration update timer value based on a network determined\nunavailability period duration.  \nThe AMF shall include the LADN information which consists of the\ndetermined LADN DNNs for the UE and LADN service area(s) available in\nthe current registration area in the LADN information IE of the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nIf the UE has set the LADN-DS bit to \\\"LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI\nsupported\\\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST\nmessage and the extended LADN information is available for the UE, the\nAMF shall include the extended LADN information which consists of the\ndetermined LADN DNNs for the UE, the S-NSSAIs associated with the\ndetermined LADN DNNs for the UE and in the allowed NSSAI, and LADN\nservice area(s) available in the current registration area in the\nExtended LADN information IE in the Registration accept type 6 IE\ncontainer IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nIf:  \n\\- the UE does not support LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI;  \n\\- the UE is subscribed to the LADN DNN for a single S-NSSAI only; and  \n\\- the AMF only has the extended LADN information;  \nthe AMF may decide to provide the LADN service area for that LADN DNN of\nthe extended LADN information as the LADN information and include the\nLADN information in the LADN information IE of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE\nCOMMAND message.  \nNOTE\u00a05A: If the LADN service area is configured per DNN and S-NSSAI, in\norder to serve the UEs that do not support LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI, it\nis recommended that the LADN DNN is only served by a single S-NSSAI.  \nNOTE\u00a05B: In case of the UE is subscribed to the LADN DNN for multiple\nS-NSSAIs, the AMF can treat this as no extended LADN information is\navailable.  \nIf the UE does not support LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI and the AMF has\nneither the LADN information nor the extended LADN information, the AMF\nshall not provide any LADN information to the UE.  \nThe UE, upon receiving the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the LADN\ninformation, shall store the received LADN information. The UE, upon\nreceiving the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the Extended LADN\ninformation, shall store the received extended LADN information. If\nthere exists one or more LADN DNNs which are included in the LADN\nindication IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and are not included\nin the LADN information IE and Extended LADN information IE in the\nRegistration accept type 6 IE container IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage, the UE considers such LADN DNNs as not available in the current\nregistration area.  \nThe 5G-GUTI reallocation shall be part of the initial registration\nprocedure. During the initial registration procedure, if the AMF has not\nallocated a new 5G-GUTI by the generic UE configuration update\nprocedure, the AMF shall include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the\nnew assigned 5G-GUTI together with the assigned TAI list.  \nIf the UE has set the CAG bit to \\\"CAG supported\\\" in the 5GMM\ncapability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF needs to\nupdate the \\\"CAG information list\\\" stored in the UE, the AMF shall\ninclude the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list\nIE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nNOTE\u00a06: The \\\"CAG information list\\\" can be provided by the AMF and\ninclude no entry if no \\\"CAG information list\\\" exists in the\nsubscription.  \nNOTE\u00a07: If the UE supports extended CAG information list, the CAG\ninformation list can be included either in the CAG information list IE\nor Extended CAG information list IE.  \nIf the UE does not support extended CAG information list, the CAG\ninformation list shall not be included in the Extended CAG information\nlist IE.  \nIf a 5G-GUTI or the SOR transparent container IE is included in the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter\nstate 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in\nsubclause\u00a05.1.3.2.3.3.  \nIf the Operator-defined access category definitions IE, the Extended\nemergency number list IE, the CAG information list IE or the Extended\nCAG information list IE are included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message,\nthe AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state\n5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause\u00a05.1.3.2.3.3.  \nIf the UE has set the RCMAP bit to \\\"Sending of REGISTRATION COMPLETE\nmessage for negotiated PEIPS assistance information supported\\\" in the\n5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and if the\nNegotiated PEIPS assistance information IE is included in the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter\nstate 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in\nsubclause\u00a05.1.3.2.3.3.  \nIf the UE is not in NB-N1 mode and the UE has set the RACS bit to \\\"RACS\nsupported\\\" in the 5GMM Capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST\nmessage, the AMF may include either a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE\nradio capability ID deletion indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage. If the UE radio capability ID IE or the UE radio capability ID\ndeletion indication IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message,\nthe AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state\n5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause\u00a05.1.3.2.3.3.  \nThe AMF shall include the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage only if the MICO indication IE was included in the REGISTRATION\nREQUEST message, the AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO mode. If\nthe AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO mode, the AMF may indicate\n\\\"all PLMN registration area allocated\\\" in the MICO indication IE in\nthe REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If \\\"all PLMN registration area\nallocated\\\" is indicated in the MICO indication IE, the AMF shall not\nassign and include the TAI list in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If\nthe REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included an MICO indication IE\nindicating \\\"all PLMN registration area allocated\\\", the UE shall treat\nall TAIs in the current PLMN as a registration area and delete its old\nTAI list. If \\\"strictly periodic registration timer supported\\\" is\nindicated in the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message,\nthe AMF may indicate \\\"strictly periodic registration timer supported\\\"\nin the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nThe AMF shall include an active time value in the T3324 IE in the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UE requested an active time value in\nthe REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF accepts the use of MICO\nmode and the use of active time.  \nIf the AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO, and the UE included the\nRequested T3512 value IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, then the\nAMF shall take into account the T3512 value requested when providing the\nT3512 value IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nNOTE\u00a07A: The T3512 value assigned to the UE by AMF can be different from\nthe T3512 value requested by the UE. AMF can take several factors into\naccount when assigning the T3512 value, e.g. local configuration,\nexpected UE behaviour, UE requested T3512 value, UE subscription data,\nnetwork policies.  \nThe AMF shall include the T3512 value IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT\nmessage only if the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was sent over the 3GPP\naccess.  \nThe AMF shall include the non-3GPP de-registration timer value IE in the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message only if the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was\nsent over the non-3GPP access.  \nIf the UE requests \\\"control plane CIoT 5GS optimization\\\" in the 5GS\nupdate type IE, indicates support of control plane CIoT 5GS optimization\nin the 5GMM capability IE and the AMF decides to accept the requested\nCIoT 5GS optimization and the registration request, the AMF shall\nindicate \\\"control plane CIoT 5GS optimization supported\\\" in the 5GS\nnetwork feature support IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nThe AMF may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value\nin the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if:  \n\\- the UE has indicated support for service gap control in the\nREGISTRATION REQUEST message; and  \n\\- a service gap time value is available in the 5GMM context.  \nIf there is a running T3447 timer in the AMF and the Follow-on request\nindicator is set to \\\"Follow-on request pending\\\" in the REGISTRATION\nREQUEST message, the AMF shall ignore the flag and proceed as if the\nflag was not received except for the following cases:  \na\\) the UE is configured for high priority access in the selected PLMN;\nor  \nb\\) the 5GS registration type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is\nset to \\\"emergency registration\\\".  \nIf the UE has indicated support for the control plane CIoT 5GS\noptimizations, and the AMF decides to activate the congestion control\nfor transport of user data via the control plane, then the AMF shall\ninclude the T3448 value IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.  \nIf:  \n\\- the UE in NB-N1 mode is using control plane CIoT 5GS optimization;\nand  \n\\- the network is configured to provide the truncated 5G-S-TMSI\nconfiguration for control plane CIoT 5GS optimizations;  \nthe AMF shall include the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI configuration IE in the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message and set the \\\"Truncated AMF Set ID value\\\"\nand the \\\"Truncated AMF Pointer value\\\" in the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI\nconfiguration IE based on network policies. The AMF shall start timer\nT3550 and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in\nsubclause\u00a05.1.3.2.3.3.  \nIf the UE has included the service-level device ID set to the CAA-level\nUAV ID in the Service-level-AA container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST\nmessage, and if:  \n> \\- the UE has a valid aerial UE subscription information;\n>\n> \\- the UUAA procedure is to be performed during the registration\n> procedure according to operator policy;\n>\n> \\- there is no valid successful UUAA result for the UE in the UE 5GMM\n> context; and\n>\n> \\- the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was not received over non-3GPP\n> access,  \nthen the AMF shall initiate the UUAA-MM procedure with the UAS-NF as\nspecified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.256\u00a0\\[6AB\\] and shall include a service-level-AA\npending indication in the Service-level-AA container IE of the\nREGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

In a\nUE with IMS voice over PS session capability, the IMS voice over PS\nsession indicator, the Emergency services support indicator, and the\nEmergency services fallback indicator shall be provided to the upper\nlayers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator\ninto account when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or\ncalls. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicator (5G-LCS)\nshall be provided to the upper layers. When initiating an emergency\ncall, the upper layers also take the IMS voice over PS session\nindicator, the Emergency services support indicator, and the Emergency\nservices fallback indicator into account for the access domain\nselection. In a UE with the capability for ATSSS, the network support\nfor ATSSS shall be provided to the upper layers. If the UE receives the\n5GS network feature support IE with the ATSSS support indicator set to\n\\\"ATSSS not supported\\\", the UE shall perform a local release of the MA\nPDU session, if any. In a UE that supports non-3GPP access path\nswitching, the network support for non-3GPP access path switching shall\nbe provided to the upper layers. If the UE receives the 5GS network\nfeature support IE with the non-3GPP access path switching bit set to\n\\\"non-3GPP access path switching not supported\\\", the UE shall not\nperform the registration procedure for mobility registration update for\nnon-3GPP access path switching.  \nNOTE\u00a017: If the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP and\nnon-3GPP accesses, the UE uses the capability received over non-3GPP\naccess to determine whether to initiate the registration procedure for\nmobility registration update for non-3GPP path switching.  \nThe AMF shall set the EMF bit in the 5GS network feature support IE to:  \na\\) \\\"Emergency services fallback supported in NR connected to 5GCN and\nE-UTRA connected to 5GCN\\\" if the network supports the emergency\nservices fallback procedure when the UE is in an NR cell connected to\n5GCN or an E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN;  \nb\\) \\\"Emergency services fallback supported in NR connected to 5GCN\nonly\\\" if the network supports the emergency services fallback procedure\nwhen the UE is in an NR cell connected to 5GCN and does not support the\nemergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an E-UTRA cell\nconnected to 5GCN;  \nc\\) \\\"Emergency services fallback supported in E-UTRA connected to 5GCN\nonly\\\" if the network supports the emergency services fallback procedure\nwhen the UE is in an E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN and does not support\nthe emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an NR cell\nconnected to 5GCN; or  \nd\\) \\\"Emergency services fallback not supported\\\" if network does not\nsupport the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in any\ncell connected to 5GCN.  \nNOTE\u00a018: If the emergency services are supported in neither the EPS nor\nthe 5GS homogeneously, based on operator policy, the AMF will set the\nEMF bit in the 5GS network feature support IE to \\\"Emergency services\nfallback not supported\\\".  \nNOTE\u00a019: Even though the AMF\\'s support of emergency services fallback\nis indicated per RAT, the UE\\'s support of emergency services fallback\nis not per RAT, i.e. the UE\\'s support of emergency services fallback is\nthe same for both NR connected to 5GCN and E-UTRA connected to 5GCN.  \nAccess identity 1 is only applicable while the UE is in N1 mode. Access\nidentity 2 is only applicable while the UE is in N1 mode.  \nWhen the UE is registered to the same PLMN or SNPN over 3GPP and\nnon-3GPP access, the UE and the AMF maintain one MPS indicator and one\nMCS indicator that are common to both 3GPP and non-3GPP access. When the\nUE is registered to different PLMNs or SNPNs over 3GPP access and\nnon-3GPP access, the UE maintains two MPS indicators and two MCS\nindicators separately for different accesses i.e., an MPS indicator and\nan MCS indicator for the 3GPP access and another MPS indicator and an\nMCS indicator for the non-3GPP access. For both 3GPP and non-3GPP\naccess, the access identity is determined according to subclause\u00a04.5.2:  \n\\- if the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode:  \na\\) the network informs the UE that the use of access identity 1 is\nvalid in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN by setting the MPS indicator bit\nof the 5GS network feature support IE to \\\"Access identity 1 valid\\\", in\nthe REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

The proposed change seeks to explicitly state that the AMF has the capability to make this determination during the initial registration process.
